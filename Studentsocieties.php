      <p data-aos="fade-right" id="textp">We are the wizards of words, cracks in the lenses of conventionalism, curators of curiosity. Our work is to define the definitions themselves. Vagmita Debsoc was founded with one motive: making its members its namesake: Vagmita, meaning ‘eloquence’. The word eloquence has its origin in the ‘eloqui’, meaning ‘speak out, which is essentially what we do; speaking out what needs to be said, and more importantly, what needs to be heard. Vagmita Debsoc has ventured into parliamentary debating, extempores, group discussions, and many other custom forms of debating apart from the conventional ones, in Hindi and in English as well. Even though still in relatively nascent stages, Vagmita Debsoc has established a niche for itself in the debating sphere, owing to the relentless debaters it has had over the years. The society has won major accolades across the debating circuit, including the coveted ‘Best Society’ award from the Education Tree. Over the years, Vagmita Debsoc has become a space for people to disagree without falling out, emphasizing on that fact that the aim of debating is not to agree, but to accept and understand, even when one disagrees with it. The society vies to continue doing that, along with further establishing itself in the debating circuit. </p>
