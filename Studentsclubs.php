The herbal garden established in year 2017 is maintained as a conservatory to species of aromatic medicinal herbs. The green cover of the college is raised carefully for maintenance of the aesthetics and flora in college campus. For effective on- campus waste disposal, the composting pits are functional to convert waste into green manure.
                        <br> The students of the college participated in the Ozone Day celebration held at Delhi Secretariat on 16 th September 2019. Priyanshi Madan, a student of Psychology (Hons.) Semester VI got awarded as runners up.
                        <br> The EVS Department. in collaboration with NSS and Environment Club of the college, organized an event based on the initiative launched by WWF-India in partnership with UN Environment, <b><i>"The Young Leaders Plastic Challenge"</i></b> which was held on 24 th September 2019. The challenge was an initiative for engaging youth across the country to address the issue of plastic pollution threatening life in oceans, rivers and on land. The initiative intended to educate young individuals on single-use plastics leading to action that will reduce land and marine plastic pollution. This can also lead to a sense of personal fulfilment in taking responsibility for the planet’s well-being. This initiative offered an opportunity to college students to take leadership role to inspire and engage their peers in collective action within their communities or institutions to tackle the menace of single-use plastic. The students of the college took this up as a project to reduce usage of plastic in the college as well as at their homes.</p>

It endeavors to highlight gender discrimination as a systematic framework which treats individuals unfairly on the basis of their gender. It aims to create a gender-aware and gender-just environment within the campus. The Cell creates gender awareness by initiating debates on domestic violence, sexual harassment, and other issues faced by women through organizing essay/ poster competitions, movie screenings and holding talks and seminars thereby sensitizing the students about them. Prominent speakers like Ms. Susheela Kaushik, Prof. Indira Nath, Dr. Sumathi Rao Mehta and many more have visited our campus and have helped us further the outreach of the cell.
                        <br> The Women’s Development Cell finds its actual power in initiating conversations on a variety of issues ranging from pressing social concerns to intensely personal problems. We recognize that, whereas on the one hand, it is our social and moral obligation to reflect on the existing hierarchies and differences and to oppose the growing violence, on the other it is also imperative to view women as having the agency and capability to be effective. The Women’s Development Cell at Keshav Mahavidyalaya attempts to increase the student participation and visibility in all realms of academic and non-academic life of the college and strives to capacitate young minds with adequate perspectives and abilities to work towards creating gender-just spaces. </p>
